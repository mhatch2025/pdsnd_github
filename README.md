# Fun with Bikeshare Data

 This program helps users explore US bikeshare data through an interactive command-line interface. It looks at bike-sharing data from three big cities in the U.S.: **Chicago, New York City, and Washington**.

## What This Program Does


Once you run the program, you'll be asked to choose a city and filter the data by month or day. Then it will show you different stats, like:

- When people ride the most
- Which stations are most popular
- How long trips usually take
- Info about the riders _(like user type or birth year)_
- The most popular combinations of start and end stations

It also gives you the option to look at the raw data if you're curious.

## How to Use It

1. Download or clone this project.
2. It runs on Python, you also need Pandas
3. Put the data files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, and `washington.csv`) in the same folder.
    _Only two of the three cities have age related data sets_
4. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
python bikeshare.py
